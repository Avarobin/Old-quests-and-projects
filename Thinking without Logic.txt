Title:
Thinking without Logic

Information:
This short sidescroller has been made for the One Month VG Crossover Quest Contest in january 2016. It takes place in the world of Portal
and features a bunch of challenges, puzzles and surprises.

Description:
The main inspiration for this quest is Portal 1 and references in the quest are limited to Portal 1. The quest is fairly short and should be
beatable in about 20 minutes I'd guess. Most chambers follow different logics because you are in a dream, so be ready for random
things to happen. The controls are being told to you ingame.

This quest borrows the scripted engine of one of my other quests. I'm glad that I've made my script somewhat commented out and easily
understandable, and so I've copied it and modified it for this quest. I will definetly reuse this engine again in the future for a bigger game, so
I'm happy about the new things that I created for this.

Story:
The player character is put to sleep by Aperture Science with their new dream manipulation system. The tests now take place within your
dream. Science can be done asleep now!

Tested in 2.50.1 and 2.50.2. Should also work in 2.50 and future versions too. This is a rather short sidescroller that features
a bunch of puzzles, challenges and surprises. The main inspiration for this quest is Portal 1. I made this quest in just a few days,
because at first I wasn't planning on participating, but then I got the idea for this quest.
