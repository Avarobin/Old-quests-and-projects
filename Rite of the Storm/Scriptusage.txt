---Things to keep in mind for every screen---

Use Layer 3 as background.
Flag 16 and 17 are used by switches and barriers
Damage Combo Sensitivity should be 5 for fog.

---Item pickup script---

D0: message
D1: 0 = normal, 1 = links wind powerup, 2 = link defense powerup

---Signpost---

Has to be placed as an FFC on top of the talkable object.

D0: message
D1: 0 = from south only, 1 = from any direction

---Chests---

Use them the regular way. No FFC needs to be placed. Only 1 chest per screen.
Since the chests have to be Boss Chests, there should be no boss keys.

---Switches---

Place one or more switch combos on the screen. No FFC needs to be placed.
When all switches are triggered, it triggers screen secrets. Triggering only some switches resets them after leaving the screen.
Switches have inherent flag 16, barriers have inherent flag 17.
Don't place too many switches on a screen. Every switch combo makes use of one of the 32 FFC slots.

---Red & Blue Barriers & Switches---

Same as switches, pretty much. Only ever place down Red Switches, Red Barriers (Up) and Blue Barriers (Down).
Triggering a Red/Blue switch changes the state of Red & Blue on all screens on the map.

---Wind Shooter---

Place it on the screen as an FFC.
If D3 is not 0, "Run Script at Screen Init" should be checked. Otherwise it doesn't matter if its checked or not.

D0: 0 = down, 1 = right, 2 = up, 3 = left
D1: frames between each shot
D2: initial delay
D3: 0 = normal, 1 = turn on when secrets are triggered, 2 = turn off when secrets are triggered

---Torches and Mirrors---

These combos can be placed without any limits. Don't make them pushable.
The combo cycling for the torches is scripted.

---Fog---

No limits here either. Damage combo sensitity should be 5.
Place down the walkable combo.

---Torch Puzzle---

Placing this on a screen allows for a torch puzzle which triggers screen secrets when solved.

D0: 0 = light all non-relighting torches, 1 = unlight all non-relighting torches
